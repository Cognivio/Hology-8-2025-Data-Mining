This repository contains our submission for the **Data Mining Competition** held during **Hology 8 Universitas Brawijaya (2025)** in the **qualifying round**.  

We experimented with several approaches using different model architectures and backbone combinations to improve performance. The scenarios we explored include:

- Training a model from scratch  
- Using **CSR-Net** as the backbone  
- Using **VGG** as the backbone  
- Combining **SFCN + VGG** (backbone)  

Among these, the **SFCN + VGG** configuration achieved the best results.
